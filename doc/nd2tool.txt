	      nd2tool iiQV015_20220630_001.nd2

       it will create the following files:

	      iiQV015_20220630_001
	      ├── A488_001.tif
	      ├── A488_002.tif
	      ├── A488_003.tif
	      ├── A647_001.tif
	      ├── A647_002.tif
	      ├── A647_003.tif
	      ├── dapi_001.tif
	      ├── dapi_002.tif
	      ├── dapi_003.tif
	      ├── nd2tool.log.txt
	      ├── SpGold_001.tif
	      ├── SpGold_002.tif
	      └── SpGold_003.tif

       i.e. a new folder with the same name as the input  file	excluding  the

       saved as a separate file with the scheme CHANNEL_FOV.tif	 were  FOV  is
       padded with 0s to always return three digits.
